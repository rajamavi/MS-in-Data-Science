1. Product Searches:
   - Data Points:
     - Timestamp
     - User ID
     - Interaction Type (e.g., "search")
     - Product ID (if applicable)
     - Search Query (if applicable)

2. Product Views:
   - Data Points:
     - Timestamp
     - User ID
     - Interaction Type (e.g., "view")
     - Product ID
     - Additional attributes related to the viewed product (e.g., product name, category)

3. Adding Items to the Cart:
   - Data Points:
     - Timestamp
     - User ID
     - Interaction Type (e.g., "add_to_cart")
     - Product ID
     - Additional attributes related to the added product (e.g., product name, category)

4. Completing Purchases:
   - Data Points:
     - Timestamp
     - User ID
     - Interaction Type (e.g., "purchase")
     - Product ID (for each purchased item)
     - Additional attributes related to the purchased product (e.g., product name, category)
     - Purchase details (e.g., total amount, order ID)

Let's define the MySQL tables for the data points discussed earlier. Additionally, we'll create Python classes to represent these entities. Keep in mind that this is a simplified representation, and in a real-world scenario, you might have additional considerations such as indexing, constraints, and normalization.

### MySQL Tables:

1. User Profiles Table:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
       user_id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
       username VARCHAR(255),
       email VARCHAR(255),
       location VARCHAR(255)
       -- Additional attributes as needed
   );
   ```

2. Product Data Table:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE product_data (
       product_id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(255),
       category VARCHAR(255),
       price DECIMAL(10, 2)
       -- Additional attributes as needed
   );
   ```

3. User Interactions Table:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE user_interactions (
       interaction_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       timestamp DATETIME,
       user_id VARCHAR(36),
       interaction_type ENUM('search', 'view', 'add_to_cart', 'purchase'),
       product_id VARCHAR(36),
       -- Additional attributes related to the interaction
       FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user_profiles(user_id),
       FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES product_data(product_id)
   );
   ```

### Python Classes:

Here are simplified Python classes using the `dataclasses` module for representing the entities:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime

@dataclass
class UserProfile:
    user_id: str
    username: str
    email: str
    location: str
    # Additional attributes as needed

@dataclass
class ProductData:
    product_id: str
    name: str
    category: str
    price: float
    # Additional attributes as needed

@dataclass
class UserInteraction:
    interaction_id: int  # If using a database-generated ID
    timestamp: datetime
    user_id: str
    interaction_type: str  # 'search', 'view', 'add_to_cart', 'purchase'
    product_id: str
    # Additional attributes related to the interaction
```
