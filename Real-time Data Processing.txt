1. Continuous Data Generation:
   - Implement Python simulation classes (e.g., `UserInteractionSimulation`) for 24x7 continuous generation of synthetic user interaction data.
   - Integrate Kafka producers within the simulation classes to publish generated data to relevant Kafka topics.

2. Kafka Setup:
   - Create Kafka topics to represent different streams of data, such as user interactions.
   - Configure partitions and replication factors based on scalability and fault-tolerance requirements.

3. PySpark Streaming Application:
   - Set up a PySpark environment for real-time streaming data processing.
   - Develop a PySpark streaming application that acts as a Kafka consumer, subscribing to the user interaction Kafka topic.

4. Data Persistence and Storage:
   - Extend the PySpark streaming application to persist the processed data into multiple storage formats, including MySQL, Parquet, and CSV.
   - Configure the PySpark application to write relevant data to MySQL tables, ensuring proper schema alignment. Utilize the MySQL database to store user interaction data for relational querying and analysis.
   - Integrate Parquet as a storage format for efficient and columnar storage of streaming data. Write processed data to Parquet files for optimal performance in big data processing.
   - Implement CSV output functionality to store processed data in CSV files. Generate CSV files as an additional storage option for compatibility with machine learning algorithms and data visualization tools.

These actions collectively define the steps involved in real-time data processing, from data generation to storage, ensuring adaptability and accessibility for subsequent analyses and applications.
